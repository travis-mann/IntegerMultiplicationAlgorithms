### IntegerMultiplicationAlgorithms

Various integer multiplication algorithms for Stanfords Algorithm course with unit test cases for each algorithm. 
1. Grade School: Computes partial products for each digit in one integer with each digit of the other integer and sums the result. Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>) for ~2n operations for each partial products and n partial products to sum.

2. Recursive Multiplication: Divide and conquer integer multiplication algorithm. Uses recursion to solve down to the base case of multiplying 2 single digit integers. Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

3. Karatsubas Algorithm: Karatsuba's algorithm for integer multiplication. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm for more details. Time Complexity: O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>3</sup>)
